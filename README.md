## Hi 👋 All!

My name is Javi and I'm a software developer who loves to build scalable apps.

At the beginning of my journey, I thought it was necessary to be proficient in everything. 

This way, I focused on software fundamentals and React stack, sharing tips of my experience on Linkedin.


# Some of my hightlight projects

  It suggests the perfect way to relax.

**Calorix**: Calculates how many calories are burned based on sport and intensity.
