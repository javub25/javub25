## Hi 👋 All!

My name is Javi and I'm a software developer who loves to build scalable apps.

At the beginning of my journey, I thought it was necessary to be proficient in everything.

Thay's why I focused on software fundamentals and React stack.

Sharing tips, projects and useful information for others on Linkedin.
